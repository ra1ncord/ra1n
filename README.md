# Welcome to **ra1n**
ra1n is a work-in-progress custom Discord client for android, designed to be lightweight and feature-packed!

## What is ra1n?
ra1n is a work-in-progress custom client for discord aimed at being written from the ground up, depending on code from as little projects as possible (minus the kotlin side). 

## What started the creation of ra1n
ra1n's development was started after i had a disagreement with the developer of a discord mod which i forked (i believe this to be sorted now, however for other reasons i still believe making my own client mod will be the better call). details will not be shared due to wanting to keep it civil but I realised creating a client from scratch was a better call for the community, my mental health and development.

## When will ra1n be available and what devices will it be available for?
ra1n currently is still nowhere near a state where it is ready for any sort of release. as for platforms it will be available for, android is the target however iOS is something that is being planned!

## How can I support the project?
ra1n can be supported in many ways, you can [contribute](#Contributing), make a [bug report](#Bug-reporting) or [donate](https://www.ko-fi.com/cocobo1)

## Bug-reporting
Bug reports are a crucial part of development, they make the project more stable and make developers aware of issues. before filing an issue please make sure it isnt a duplicate

## Contributing
Contributing can be many things: a bug fix, a new plugin, translation. git commits are made in the layout of: category(target): what you did e.g. "made #### be #####"
